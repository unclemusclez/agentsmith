## Agent Smith 😎: Visualize Your Agent Chains

Welcome to Agent Smith, a work-in-progress Streamlit application designed to help you visually compose and manipulate complex agent workflows using Mermaid charts! 🧜‍♀️

**The Vision:**

Agent Smith allows you to define modular agents (think of them as building blocks for AI tasks) and connect them into intricate chains using intuitive Mermaid syntax.  

**How it Works:**

1. **Design Your Workflow:** Craft your agent chain using Mermaid diagrams, specifying the types of agents and their connections.
2. **Import & Visualize:** Paste your Mermaid chart into Agent Smith. The app will parse your chart and display a visual representation of your agent workflow using Streamlit Flow. 🌊
3. **Build & Experiment:**  Agent Smith is designed to be flexible, allowing you to easily add, remove, or rearrange agents in your chain.

**Stay Tuned!**

This project is still under development, but we're excited about its potential to simplify the creation and understanding of complex agent systems. 🚀

Feel free to contribute ideas or report any issues you encounter. Let's build something awesome together! 💪
